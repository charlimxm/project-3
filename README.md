### FoodSpace

How Customers would use this:
1. When a Customer loads the landing page, they can search for particular menu items they enjoy
2. A list of various restaurants serving the menu item appears, allowing customers to see which restaurant is the most popular for that specific menu item
3. Customers can upvote the menu items they prefer, allowing the public to control rankings of the menu items
4. Customers can upload pictures of dishes they enjoy if they are not in the list, subject to verification by admins
5. Customers must register and login to vote/upload

How Restaurant Owners/Staff would use this:
1. Owners can see where their menu items are located in the rankings and choose to give discounts on the specific menu items
3. Owners can also gain valuable feedback in the form of user ratings and reviews to adapt their menu
4. Owners are required to submit updated menus periodically to admins to confirm that dishes actually exist
