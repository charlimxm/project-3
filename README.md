How Customers would use this:
1. When a Customer loads the landing page, they can search for restaurants to book either by cuisine and location OR by the restaurant name
2. Customers can view different restaurant details and seating chart for availability
3. However, Customers must register and login to actually make a booking
4. Customers can make multiple bookings for different restaurants at any one time

How Restaurant Owners/Staff would use this:
1. Owners have to register and login to create/edit their restaurant details page (incl. restaurant number, address, max seats, opening hours)
2. Both Owners and Staff(waiters) have access to restaurant details and customersâ€™ booking details (incl. number of pax, time, date, comments)
